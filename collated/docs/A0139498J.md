> _The class diagram for the Model component of DearJim_

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Task Manager data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

#### Use case: UC02 - List all undone tasks

**MSS**

1. User enters the `list` command
2. TaskManager parses the `list` command
3. TaskManager removes any filters for the task list and updates the GUI to display the entire list of undone tasks<br>

Use case ends

**Extensions**

2a. User enters an input that does not follow the `list` command format

>2a1. TaskManager displays an error message on the GUI, informing the user of the correct format for the `list` command and an example `list` command <br>
 Use case resumes at step 1

2b. The list is empty

> Use case ends

#### Use case: UC04 - Delete an undone task

**MSS**

1. User requests to list undone tasks (UC02)
2. TaskManager shows the list of all undone tasks
3. User enters the `delete` command, specifying the `INDEX` of the task in the list to be deleted
4. TaskManager parses the `delete` command and looks for the task in the list
5. TaskManager deletes the task from the list
6. TaskManager updates the GUI to display the new list of undone tasks<br>

Use case ends

**Extensions**

2a. The list is empty

> Use case ends

4a. The given index is invalid

> 4a1. TaskManager displays an error message on the GUI, informing the user that the given index is invalid and thus cannot delete any task <br>
  Use case resumes at step 3

4b. User enters an input that does not follow the `delete` command format

>4b1. TaskManager displays an error message on the GUI, informing the user of the correct format for the `delete` command and an example `delete` command <br>

### Changing storage location: `store`
Need to look at your task on the move? Simply store the data at another location and bring it along with you.<br>
In addition to changing the storage file location, `store` handles your existing data in two different ways, depending if the filepath you specify is an existing storage file.<br>
If the storage file specified is not present, DearJim will create this new file and store your current data in it.<br>
If the storage file specified is present, data will be loaded from this storage file into DearJim.<br>
Format: `store FILEPATH`
> DearJim data is stored in XML file format. There is no need to specify the file extension `.xml`, it will be appended to your target file name automatically. `store` supports both relative and absolute file paths.


Examples:
* `store data/onthemove`
* `store /Users/jim/Dropbox/filename`

<br/>


### Exiting the application: `exit`
Closes the application.<br>
Format: `exit`

<br/>
