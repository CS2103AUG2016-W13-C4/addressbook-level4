> _The class diagram for the Model component of DearJim_

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Task Manager data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

2a. User enters an input that does not follow the `list` command format

>2a1. TaskManager displays an error message on the GUI, informing the user of the correct format for the `list` command and an example `list` command <br>
