#### Use case: UC03 - Edit an undone task

**MSS**

1. User requests to list undone tasks (UC02)
2. TaskManager shows the list of all undone tasks
3. User enters the `edit` command, specifying the `INDEX` of the task in the list to be edited, the fields to be edited and their new values
4. TaskManager parses the `edit` command and looks for the task in the list
5. TaskManager edits the requested fields on the specified task according to the command entered
6. TaskManager updates the GUI to display the new list of undone tasks and highlight the newly edited task <br>

Use case ends

**Extensions**

2a. The list is empty

> Use case ends

3a. Index is not given

> 3a1. TaskManager displays an error message on the GUI, informing the user of the correct format for the `edit` command and an example `edit` command <br>
 Use case resumes at step 3

3b. User enters a task name that needs to be escaped as it contains values that CommandParser is unable to parse rightly.

> 3b1. TaskManager's instant parsing feature reflects to the user that his / her input is being parsed into the wrong field
> 3b2. User uses the double inverted commas to escape the task name <br>
Use case resumes at step 3


4a. The given index is invalid

> 4a1. TaskManager displays an error message on the GUI, informing the user that the given index is invalid and thus cannot edit any task <br>
  Use case resumes at step 3

4b. User enters an end date that occurs before the start date.

>4b1. TaskManager displays an error message on the GUI, informing the user that the end date must occur after the start date <br>
 Use case resumes at step 3

4c. User enters an input that does not follow the `edit` command format

>4c1. TaskManager displays an error message on the GUI, informing the user of the correct format for the `edit` command and an example `edit` command <br>
 Use case resumes at step 3

<strong>Summary:</strong> We observed that these products have very good features, but we realised that none of these products have the specific combination of features that caters to our target audience. Therefore, we are incorporating some of the good features such as minimalistic interface and ability to sync with multiple computers while designing DearJim carefully to avoid the pitfalls found in these products, to make a targeted product for our intended audience.

**_Specifying task priority_**

You can assign a `PRIORITY` of `low`, `medium` or `high` to your task. <br>
Tasks have `medium` `PRIORITY` by default.<br>
Keyword: `-PRIORITY`


To specify the priority for a task, input a `-` followed by the `PRIORITY`.<br>
`PRIORITY` also accepts variations of `low`, `medium` and `high`.

`PRIORITY` | Variations  
-------- | :--------:
`low` | `l`, `low`
`medium` | `m`, `med`, `medium`
`high` | `h`, `high`


Examples:
* `Watch drama -l`
* `Buy coffee powder -med`
* `Buy washing powder -high`

<br/>

### Editing a task: `edit`
Just in case you need to change any details, or add in missing ones into your task, simply edit them in DearJim.  <br>
Format: `edit INDEX [NAME] [start DATE_TIME] [end DATE_TIME] [repeat every RECURRING_INTERVAL] [-PRIORITY]`

> `INDEX` refers to the task number in the current displayed list.<br>
> Note: `edit` has a very similar format to `add`.

Examples:
* `Company meeting tonight at 7pm to 9pm`
* `edit 2 Company meeting tomorrow morning at 7am to 9am -high`
* `Buy coffee for boss by 8am repeat every day`
* `edit 3 Buy coffee for boss by 7am repeat every 2 days`

<br/>

**_Editing out details in a task_**

 You can also remove parameters that are no longer relevant. <br>
 Format: `edit INDEX [-reset parameter] [repeat] [start] [end] `

|`-reset parameter`|Result|
|---|---|
|`-reset repeat`| Removes recurring interval from task|
|`-reset start`| Removes start time from task|
|`-reset end`| Removes end time from task|

Examples:
* `Buy coffee for boss, by 8am repeat every day`
* `edit 1 -reset repeat start`
* `edit 2 -reset end`

> Note: `-reset` will override any `edit` of the same field that comes before it in your input.

### Finding a task: `find`
Forgot about the details of a task that you have added earlier? You can find an existing task by its name.<br>
Format: `find NAME`
> `find` is case-insensitive - `find AKSHAY` will match `find akshay`
>
> If no NAME is provided, all uncompleted tasks will be displayed

Examples:
* `find Akshay`
* `find company meeting`
* `find`

<br/>
