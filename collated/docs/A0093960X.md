### UI component

> _The class diagram for the UI component of DearJim_

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `TaskCard`, `SwitchViewButtons`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layouts of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands and updates the user input history (to navigate the previous and next inputs using <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow keys) using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the `UI` accordingly.

#### Use case: UC05 - Undo a previous command

**MSS**

1. User enters an `undo` command
2. TaskManager parses the `undo` command
3. TaskManager attempts to identify the latest stored undoable command, reversing the action of that command
4. TaskManager saves the modified task list to storage and updates the GUI to inform the user of the changes <br>
_Use case ends._

**Extensions**

1a. User enters an `undo` command, followed by some arguments
> 1a1. TaskManager parses the `undo` command, ignoring the arguments that follow <br>
_Use case resumes at step 3_

3a. There is no previous undoable command
> 3a1. TaskManager indicates that there is nothing to undo.<br>
_Use case ends._

4a. User wants to reverse the `undo` command
> 4a1. User enters the `redo` command (UC06) <br>
_Use case ends._


#### Use case: UC06 - Redo a command that was undone

**MSS**

1. User enters a `undo` command successfully (UC05)
2. User enters a `redo` command
3. TaskManager parses the `redo` command
4. TaskManager attempts to identify the latest stored command that was undone by an `undo`, redoing the effects of that command
5. TaskManager saves the modified task list to storage and updates the GUI to inform the user of the changes <br>
_Use case ends._


**Extensions**

1a. User enters a non-undoable command
> 1a1. TaskManager handles the command<br>
_Use case resumes at step 2_

1b. User enters an undoable command
> 1b1. TaskManager handles the command and clears the history of commands to `redo`<br>
1b2. User enters a `redo` command<br>
1b3. TaskManager parses the `redo` command and indicates that there is nothing to `redo`<br>
_Use case ends._

2a. User enters a `redo` command, followed by some arguments
> 1a1. TaskManager parses the `redo` command, ignoring the arguments that follow <br>

### Adding a task: `add`
Adds a task into DearJim.<br>
Format: `[add] NAME [start DATE_TIME] [end DATE_TIME] [repeat every RECURRING_INTERVAL] [-PRIORITY]`

>You may also substitute `start` with `from`/`at`, `end` with `to`/`by`.

By default, if no valid command is specified, the input will be treated as an `add` command. This means typing in `add` is optional. <br>
If you would like to add a task with a name that begins with other command words, just include the `add` to override the other command words. <br>

Example:

|Input|Interpreted Command| Result|
|---|---|---|---|
|`help my mum to buy cooking ingredients`| `help`| Execute `help` command|
|`add help my mum to buy cooking ingredients`| `add`| `add` a task with name `help my mum to buy cooking ingredients`|
