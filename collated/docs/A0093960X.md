### Architecture

>_The Architecture Diagram of DearJim_


The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`.

<img src="images\SDForDeleteTaskFinal.png" width="800">
> _The sequence diagram for the scenario `delete 1`_


>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskManagerChangedEvent` when the Task Manager data are changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>

<img src="images\SDForDeleteTaskEventHandlingFinal.png" width="800">
> _The sequence diagram showing the `TaskManagerChangedEvent` and effects on `Storage` and `UI`_

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagramFinal.png" width="800"><br>
> _The class diagram for the UI component of DearJim_

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `TaskCard`, `SwitchViewButtons`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layouts of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands and updates the user input history (to navigate the previous and next inputs using <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow keys) using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the `UI` accordingly.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.taskmanager.commons` package.<br>
Examples of these classes include the `StringUtil` class, which has the `containsIgnoreCase(String, String)` method, and `CollectionUtil` class, which has the `isAnyNull(Object...)` method.

#### Use case: UC05 - Undo a previous command

**MSS**

1. User enters an `undo` command
2. TaskManager parses the `undo` command
3. TaskManager attempts to identify the latest stored undoable command, reversing the action of that command
4. TaskManager saves the modified task list to storage and updates the GUI to inform the user of the changes <br>
_Use case ends._

**Extensions**

1a. User enters an `undo` command, followed by some arguments
> 1a1. TaskManager parses the `undo` command, ignoring the arguments that follow <br>
_Use case resumes at step 3_

3a. There is no previous undoable command
> 3a1. TaskManager indicates that there is nothing to undo.<br>
_Use case ends._

4a. User wants to reverse the `undo` command
> 4a1. User enters the `redo` command (UC06) <br>
_Use case ends._


#### Use case: UC06 - Redo a command that was undone

**MSS**

1. User enters a `undo` command successfully (UC05)
2. User enters a `redo` command
3. TaskManager parses the `redo` command
4. TaskManager attempts to identify the latest stored command that was undone by an `undo`, redoing the effects of that command
5. TaskManager saves the modified task list to storage and updates the GUI to inform the user of the changes <br>
_Use case ends._


**Extensions**

1a. User enters a non-undoable command
> 1a1. TaskManager handles the command<br>
_Use case resumes at step 2_

1b. User enters an undoable command
> 1b1. TaskManager handles the command and clears the history of commands to `redo`<br>
1b2. User enters a `redo` command<br>
1b3. TaskManager parses the `redo` command and indicates that there is nothing to `redo`<br>
_Use case ends._

2a. User enters a `redo` command, followed by some arguments
> 1a1. TaskManager parses the `redo` command, ignoring the arguments that follow <br>
_Use case resumes at step 3_

### Viewing help: `help`
Opens a help window that contains a cheat sheet of all the commands of DearJim.<br>
You can leave the help window open while using DearJim if you need to refer to the cheat sheet.


Format: `help`<br>

> While the help window is selected, you may close it by simply pressing any key on your keyboard!

</p>

### Input History
Use the <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow keys to navigate your input history.<br>
This gives you quick access to your previous and next inputs.


### Adding a task: `add`
Adds a task into DearJim.<br>
Format: `[add] NAME [start DATE_TIME] [end DATE_TIME] [repeat every RECURRING_INTERVAL] [-PRIORITY]`

>You may also substitute `start` with `from`/`at`, `end` with `to`/`by`.

By default, if no valid command is specified, the input will be treated as an `add` command. This means typing in `add` is optional. <br>
If you would like to add a task with a name that begins with other command words, just include the `add` to override the other command words. <br>

Example:

|Input|Interpreted Command| Result|
|---|---|---|---|
|`help my mum to buy cooking ingredients`| `help`| Execute `help` command|
|`add help my mum to buy cooking ingredients`| `add`| `add` a task with name `help my mum to buy cooking ingredients`|

```

### Undoing a command: `undo`
Reverses the effects of the previous undoable command. <br>
Helps you to undo any accidental mistakes that you have made! <br>
Format: `undo`

Commands that you can `undo` (Undoable commands):
* `add`
* `edit`
* `delete`
* `clear`
* `done`

<br/>



### Redoing a command: `redo`
Reverses a previous `undo` command. <br>
Not satisfied with your last `undo`? `redo` will reverse the `undo` for you!

Format: `redo`
> Note: `redo` can only reverse your last `undo` if no undoable commands have been entered after that `undo`.

<br/>
