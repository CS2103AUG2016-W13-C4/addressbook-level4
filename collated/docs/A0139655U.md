### Logic component

> _The class diagram for the Logic component of DearJim_

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `CommandParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The command execution can update the `History` if command executed is an `UndoableCommand`.
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>

`* * *` | user | add tasks with timeframe | know what I have to attend an event
`* * *` | user | view upcoming tasks in chronological order| check what I need to do / have to do soon
`* * *` | user | search for details on a task or event | view what needs to be done
`* * *` | user | delete a task that has been completed | completely remove it from my task manager
`* * *` | user | mark a task as completed upon completion | keep an archive of tasks that I have completed
`* * *` | user | view tasks that I have completed | recall what I have completed

## Appendix B : Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `Task Manager` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

```
###### \DeveloperGuide.md
``` md
#### Use case: UC01 - Add a task

**MSS**

1. User enters an `add` command, specifying details of the task to be added
2. TaskManager parses the `add` command, and adds the task to the current task list
3. TaskManager saves the current task list to storage and updates the GUI to display the updated list with the newly added task<br>

Use case ends

**Extensions**

1a. User enters a task name that needs to be escaped as it contains values that CommandParser is unable to parse correctly.

> 1a1. TaskManager's instant parsing feature reflects to the user that his / her input is being parsed into the wrong field
> 1a2. User uses the double inverted commas to escape the task name <br>
Use case resumes at step 2

2a. User enters an input that does not follow the `add` command format

> 2a1. TaskManager displays an error message on the GUI, informing the user of the correct format for the `add` command and an example `add` command <br>
  Use case resumes at step 1

2b. User is currently at done list view

> 2b1. TaskManger displays an error message on the GUI, informing the user that he / she is unable to perform the add command in done list view, and prompts the user to switch to undone list view instead to perform the add command <br>
  Use case resumes at step 1

3a. User identifies a mistake in the details of the task added
> 3a1. User edits the task details (UC03)<br>

> Use case ends
