**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `CommandParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>

## Appendix B : Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `Task Manager` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

```
###### \DeveloperGuide.md

#### Use case: UC01 - Add a task

**MSS**

1. User enters an `add` command, specifying details of the task to be added
2. TaskManager parses the `add` command, and adds the task to the current task list
3. TaskManager saves the current task list to storage and updates the GUI to display the updated list with the newly added task<br>

Use case ends

**Extensions**

1a. User enters an input that needs to be escaped as it contains values that CommandParser is not able to parse properly. 

> 1a1. TaskManager's instant parsing feature will reflect to the user that his / her input is being placed in the wrong field. 
> 1a2. User uses the escape feature to explicitly denote the task name. <br>
Use case resumes at step 2

2a. User enters an input that does not follow the `add` command format

> 2a1. TaskManager displays an error message on the GUI, informing the user of the correct format for the `add` command and an example `add` command <br>
  Use case resumes at step 1
  
3a. User identifies a mistake in the details of the task added
> 3a1. User edits the task details (UC03)<br>

> Use case ends
